Hello!

1. Everything is private
-> The only fields we observed to have getters were 
getX, getY in Posn 
  // OBSERVATION: used when finding the position of a cell
  // cannot define a posn without the access to x or y field
getFrom, getTo in Edge
  // OBSERVATION: the use of an edge is to know what its connected to
  // unable to use an edge without getting its from and to
getEdges in MazeCell
  // OBSERVATION: used in kruskals algorithm method to add the edges to the
  // worklist, so it can then sort and unionize them

each of these observations are documented in the purpose statements 
for each of the methods as well

2. Only one thing is not final and that is the gameMode string in 
MazeWorld because we need to change the game mode/game state as we play the game

3. Key presses:
press the arrow keys to traverse the maze manually

(warning for the following two: they are not searching correctly)
press d for depth first search animation
press b for breadth first search animation

press n for a new maze


4. when you complete the maze, an ending screen will show indicating that you found the path

5. scaling works when you change the size of the pixels in the example

class ExamplesMazeWorld {
  void testMakeScene(Tester t) {
    MazeWorld world = new MazeWorld(5, 5);
    world.bigBang(1000, 1000, 0.1);
  }
  ^^ replace the 5, 5 with (n, n)
  where n is any number u desire that fits in the limits
}
